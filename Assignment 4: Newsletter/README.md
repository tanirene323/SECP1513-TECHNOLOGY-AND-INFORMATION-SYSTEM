## 📝 Reflection

I learned that a strong digital ecosystem is essential for a reliable supply chain and the community's well-being.
I discovered the importance of technical stability, especially how Johor Port aims for "zero downtime" through advanced networks.
I realized that technology like "low-code" platforms helps staff do their jobs faster and with less stress.
I gained a clearer understanding of the four ICT pillars: Infrastructure, Business Applications, Governance, and Helpdesk.
