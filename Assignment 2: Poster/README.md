## 📝 Reflection

I learned how a global company like PPG uses Data Analytics and SAP to manage their business efficiently.
I discovered the importance of Cloud-First foundations and how they support global operations.
I learned about the internship and growth opportunities available for students in the tech industry.
I improved my ability to summarize complex information into a visual poster that is easy to understand.  

In the future, I should use less text and more icons to make the poster look cleaner and more professional.
