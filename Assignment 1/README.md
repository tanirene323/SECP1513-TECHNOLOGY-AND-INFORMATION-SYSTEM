## 📝 Reflection

What I learned from this industrial visit is how technology is applied in real-world operation at UTMDigital.
Nazrul bin Adam Chea, a staff member of UTMDigital, answered our questions and gave us a clearer understanding of how UTMDigital operates daily.
We discussed the possibility of developing a real-time bus tracking app for UTM. Learning that such R&D (Research and Development) could happen in the future was very inspiring.  

All in all, this interview has given us a better understanding of how UTMDigital operates.
