## 📝 Reflection

Through this PC Assemble Lab, I had the opportunity to learn to identify the hardware in PC. It is very challenging for me to connect the wires of different functions to the corresponding positions. From this, I learned the use of each hardware, and I will continue to learn more in the days to come.
