## 📝 Reflection

I learned that a professional technology career is built on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), not just writing code.
Through Mr. Alim's experience, I realized that documentation and management are critical for career success.
I understood the "60/40 rule"—using AI for 40% of the work while keeping 60% as my own fundamental knowledge.
